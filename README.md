# Software-Project2023

## Project description

This project is a web application for a company that rents out guesthouses and other types of temporal accommodation. The trick being that the accommodations are being shared by multiple people at the same time. Much like Uber's car sharing/pooling service, but for accommodation.

The application is meant to be used by the company's customers to book accommodations. Users would also be able to rate the accommodations and other users based on their experiences. The application would also have a feature for the company's employees to manage the accommodations and the users.

The project is based on the customer team's vision and requirements. The customer team was given a task to create a e-commerce platform based on the prompt "Hippie Hotel".

## Project stack

The frontend of the application is built with React using Tailwind CSS for styling. The backend is built with Node.js and Express. The database is built with MySQL. The application will be deployed to Render.
