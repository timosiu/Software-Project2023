# Hippy Hotel | Software Project 2023

---

## Project name: Hippy Hotel

### Project description

This project is a web application for a company that rents out guesthouses and other types of temporal accommodation. The trick being that the accommodations are "Last-Minute" deals, meaning that the accommodations are only available for a short period of time. The project takes inspiration from the idea of combining Airbnb and ResQ Club as a service.

The application is meant to be used by the company's customers to book accommodations. Users would also be able to rate the accommodations and other users based on their experiences. The application would also have a feature for the company's employees to manage the accommodations and the users. The application should also feature a forum for the users to discuss about the accommodations and other topics.

The project is based on the customer team's vision and requirements. The customer team was given a task to create a e-commerce platform based on the prompt "Hippy Hotel".
